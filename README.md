Overview of the Basic Calculator Project:
1.Project Objectives:
--Create a User-Friendly Calculator: Develop a basic calculator that prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation.
--Perform Arithmetic Operations: Implement functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
--Display Results: Output the result of the selected operation to the user.
--Error Handling: Manage potential errors, such as division by zero, to ensure the calculator functions smoothly.
2.Key Activities:
--Requirement Analysis:Identify the basic functionalities required for the calculator.
Define the user interface components for input, operation selection, and result display.
--Design: Design the command-line interface or graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
Plan the layout of buttons and display elements for the GUI version.
--Development:Implement the calculator logic in Python.
Develop functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Create a user interface using Tkinter for the GUI version.
--Testing:Test each arithmetic operation to ensure accuracy.
Validate the user interface elements for proper functionality.
Test error handling, such as division by zero and invalid inputs.
--Deployment:Deploy the calculator as a standalone application.
Ensure the application is user-friendly and accessible
--Documentation:Document the code and provide usage instructions.
Create a user manual or help guide if necessary.
3.Technologies Used:
--Python:The primary programming language used for developing the calculator.
Provides libraries for basic arithmetic operations and error handling.
--Tkinter:A standard GUI library in Python used to create the graphical user interface for the calculator.
Enables the creation of windows, buttons, and display elements.
--Command-Line Interface:An alternative interface for users preferring text-based interaction.
Uses standard input/output functions in Python.
